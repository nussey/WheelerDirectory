Legacy project I built for a project in high school, just storing it here for safe keeping.  
  
This is a simple directory app for Joseph Wheeler High School  
Features include:  
* Map of campus
* Directory of faculty with emails and phone numbers
* Useful links to Cobb County School Systems pages
* Schedule reference for different days (assembly, homeroom, etc.)
